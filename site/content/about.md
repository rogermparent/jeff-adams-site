My name is Jeff ADAMS, I served in the U.S.A.F during Desert Storm  and Iraqi Freedom and Operation Desert Shield. I worked as a Financial Service Specialist and helped establish D.F.A.S. (Defense Finance Accounting Service) for the USAF. I was then called back to work appropriations for the Counter Drug Task Force at the CDC Desk in Concord, NH. 

When my tour was up, I was assigned to PNSY Financial Services as a GS Civilian.

After 9-11, I was re-assigned to Hanscom AFB Special Actions for the FSO and Comptroller Division.

While I was at Hanscom AFB, my family and I helped provide care for our elderly Grandparents until they both passed away. After their passing, we moved back to our home in Lebanon, Maine which has been our primary residence since 1996.

When I moved back to Lebanon and received a new appointment at PNSY as the (PSD) Personal Support Detachment as the Supervisor for PNSY ME and Brunswick NAS. I was the Regional Auditor and Supervisor for the PSD Comptroller Division for the Atlantic Fleet.

I currently work as the Logistics Quality Control Inspector and Chief Counselor for Joint Personal Property Shipping Office North East Region JPPSO NE DET 2 PNSY Kittery, Maine.   

My wife and I have raised our three children here and we currently have two grandchildren that visit with us as much as they can. Spending time together as a family is very important.

I have coached many youth sports in Lebanon  including: T-ball, Little League and Babe Ruth. I started and coached for a Jr.  American Legion team in Lebanon  and  coached the Youth Soccer program in its infancy. I was the President for Noble Youth Football and the Vice President for SMYFL. I am currently the Team Manager for The American Legion Baseball Eagles Team; a team I founded in 2010. We have supported several Special Olympic programs to include an annual Softball game our Eagles players participate in. 

I was a previous Commander for the American Legion Post 8 and Founding member of the Chapter 8 Legion Riders and Currently Elected District 3 Commander. I am a relentless advocate for our U.S. Veterans and the elderly population.

I believe everything begins and ends at home, which is why I have been and continue to be involved with many local community programs. 
I attend the First Congregational Church. I am a current Masonic Member and a past Noble Grand for the I.O. O. F.

My father was a Vietnam Veteran. When I was growing up I watched men like my dad not get the help and services they needed.  I felt the duty to try to help however I could, and will continue to do so.  I continue to be a Strong Advocate for our community Veterans and the elderly.

**I served honorably in the U.S.A.F and now I am ready to serve the Town of Lebanon.**
